This project details the mechanical construction and firmware integration of a hardwired, split ergonomic keyboard (Dactyl Manuform 5x7).

---
### **Design and Fabrication**

* The physical design of the keyboard chassis was generated using an open-source generator, which used my phone to scan my hand and modify the design to fit my specific hand shape. 
### **Electronics and Control**

- **Microcontroller:** An **RP2040 microcontroller** was integrated to handle key matrix scanning and USB communication.

- **Firmware:** The keyboard operates using the **QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware**, configured to manage custom key mappings and layers specific to the ergonomic layout.
