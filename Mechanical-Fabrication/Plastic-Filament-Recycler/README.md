This project involved the complete mechanical and functional conversion of an ender 3 3D printer into a dedicated plastic filament recycling machine.

---
### **Core Project Achievements**

- **Functional Conversion:** The original 3D printer frame and electronics architecture were successfully repurposed for plastic extrusion and filament creation.

- **Additive Manufacturing for Hardware:** The machine was rebuilt almost exclusively using **3D printed components**. This self-referential design process leveraged additive manufacturing to create the gears, enclosures, and mechanical framework necessary for the new recycling function.

- **Closed-Loop Sustainability:** The result is a closed-loop system capable of taking waste plastic and converting it into new filament, directly supporting material sustainability and prototyping needs.
