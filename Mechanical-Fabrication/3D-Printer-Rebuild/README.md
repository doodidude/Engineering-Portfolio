This project involved a comprehensive hardware, electrical, and software upgrade to a 3D printer, centered on improving print reliability, precision, and remote control capabilities.

---

###  Hardware and Mechanical Upgrades

- **Custom Mechanical Integration:** Designed and installed a custom mount to simultaneously support an automatic leveling probe, an upgraded direct drive motor, and upgraded cooling fans.

- **Electrical Wiring:** Rewired the mainboard and associated components, including integrating **LED lighting** into the system.
### Firmware and Control Systems

- **Firmware Compilation:** Compiled custom Marlin firmware to correctly interface with and utilize the new automatic leveling probe and to manage the wiring for the upgraded direct drive motor.
### Software and Automation Stack

- **G-Code Streaming Server:** Repurposed an Android phone to function as a dedicated server responsible for streaming G-code directly to the printer.
- **AI-Driven Monitoring:** Integrated an AI system to analyze the video stream from the printer for real-time print failure detection.
- **Reliability Enhancements:** Utilized open-source plug-ins to further enhance the printer's operational reliability and safety protocols.
